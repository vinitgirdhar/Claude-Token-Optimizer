## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Google Chrome** (or any Chromium-based browser such as Edge or Brave)
- **Git** installed on your machine
- A **GitHub account**

### Setting Up Locally

1. **Fork the repository**

   Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of the [repository page](https://github.com/vinitgirdhar/Token-Optimizer). This creates your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork** (not the original repository):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Token-Optimizer.git
   cd Token-Optimizer
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote** so you can keep your fork in sync:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/vinitgirdhar/Token-Optimizer.git
   ```

4. **Load the extension in Chrome**:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top-right corner)
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned `Token-Optimizer` folder
   - The extension is now running from your local source code

5. After making code changes, click the **↻ Reload** button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/` to apply them. Content-script changes also require refreshing the AI platform tab (e.g., claude.ai or chatgpt.com).

---

## 🔁 Contribution Workflow

1. **Sync your fork** with the latest upstream changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your work (never commit directly to `main`):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and test them thoroughly (see [Testing Your Changes](#-testing-your-changes)).

4. **Commit** your work with a clear message (see [Commit Message Guidelines](#-commit-message-guidelines)).

5. **Push** the branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the original repository, filling in the PR template completely.

## 🌿 Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names with one of the following prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feature/` | New functionality | `feature/pptx-support` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/pdf-column-detection` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/update-readme` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | `refactor/converter-pipeline` |
| `perf/` | Performance improvements | `perf/lazy-load-ocr` |

---

## ✍️ Commit Message Guidelines

Write commit messages that explain **what** changed and **why**:

```
<type>: <short summary in imperative mood>

[optional body explaining the motivation and approach]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `chore`

**Examples:**

```
feat: add OCR fallback for scanned PDF pages
fix: prevent duplicate interception on Gemini drag-and-drop
docs: add troubleshooting section to README
```

- Keep the summary line under 72 characters
- Use the imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- Reference related issues in the body when applicable (e.g., `Fixes #12`)

---

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

1. **Fill out the PR template completely.** PRs with empty or incomplete templates may be closed or delayed. The template asks for:
   - The **type of change** (feature, bug fix, docs, etc.)
   - A **clear description** of what you added or changed and why
   - **How you tested it** (which platforms, which file types)
   - **Screenshots or recordings** for any UI-facing change
2. **Keep PRs focused.** One feature or fix per pull request — small, reviewable PRs get merged much faster than large ones.
3. **Test before submitting.** Verify your change on at least one supported AI platform with at least one supported file format.
4. **Respond to review feedback.** Reviews are collaborative — questions and change requests are part of the process.
5. A maintainer will review, request changes if needed, and merge once approved.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Guidelines

- **Vanilla JavaScript only.** This project intentionally has no build step and no framework — code runs directly as loaded by Chrome.
- **Privacy is non-negotiable.** Never introduce code that sends file contents, telemetry, or analytics to any external server. All processing must remain 100% local.
- **No new remote dependencies.** Third-party libraries must be bundled locally in `lib/` (required by Manifest V3 and our privacy guarantee).
- **Match the existing style.** Follow the naming, indentation, and commenting patterns already present in the file you're editing.
- **Mind the manifest.** If your change requires new permissions or host matches, justify them clearly in the PR description — permission creep is reviewed strictly.
- **Performance matters.** Files are parsed in the browser's main/worker threads; avoid blocking operations on large documents.

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

Since there is no automated test suite yet, manual verification is required:

1. **Reload the extension** at `chrome://extensions/` after every change.
2. **Test the popup playground:** open the extension popup, drag in a sample document, and verify the Markdown preview is correct.
3. **Test live interception:** visit a supported platform (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity), upload a file, and confirm the optimized Markdown version is attached instead of the original.
4. **Test edge cases** relevant to your change: multi-column PDFs, scanned PDFs (OCR), spreadsheets with empty rows/columns, very large files.
5. **Check the console** (both the page DevTools and the extension service worker) for errors or warnings introduced by your change.

List everything you tested in the PR template's **"How Has This Been Tested?"** section.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/vinitgirdhar/Token-Optimizer/issues) and include:

- **Environment:** Chrome version, OS, extension version
- **The AI platform** where the issue occurred (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)
- **The file type** and, if possible, a sample file that reproduces the issue (with sensitive data removed)
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Console errors**, if any

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Have an idea? Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/vinitgirdhar/Token-Optimizer/issues) describing:

- **The problem** your feature solves
- **Your proposed solution** and how it fits the extension's privacy-first, local-only philosophy
- **Alternatives** you've considered

For large features, please open an issue for discussion **before** starting work — this avoids wasted effort if the direction doesn't fit the project roadmap.

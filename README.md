**AI Token Optimizer** is an offline-capable Google Chrome extension that intercepts file uploads (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, and `.md`) on popular AI chat platforms — **Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity** — converts them locally in your browser into highly efficient, optimized Markdown, and uploads the clean Markdown version instead.

The result: massive context-window savings, lower API costs, faster AI reasoning, and no more platform-specific file size or file type friction.

## 💡 Why AI Token Optimizer?

Raw documents are extremely token-inefficient. A `.docx` or `.pdf` file carries formatting metadata, redundant whitespace, empty spreadsheet cells, and structural bloat that AI platforms tokenize anyway — burning through your context window and your usage limits.

| Without Optimizer | With Optimizer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw PDF/DOCX/XLSX uploaded as-is | Clean, structured Markdown uploaded instead |
| Bloated tokens from formatting noise | **Up to 70% fewer tokens** |
| Slower responses on large documents | Faster reasoning over compact input |
| File type & size limits get in the way | Markdown sails through every platform |
| Files uploaded to third-party servers for parsing | **Everything parsed locally in your browser** |

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **100% Local & Private** — All document parsing (PDF, Word, Excel, CSV) happens entirely inside your browser sandbox. No file data ever leaves your device.
- 📉 **Up to 70% Token Savings** — Smart compaction removes redundant whitespace, empty cells, duplicated slide content, and bloated document structure.
- ⚡ **Seamless Interception** — Automatically catches `<input type="file">` change events and drag-and-drop triggers on supported chat platforms using capture-phase event hooking. Zero extra clicks.
- 🔍 **OCR for Scanned Documents** — Built-in Tesseract.js OCR (bundled locally) extracts text from scanned/image-based PDF pages.
- 📰 **Two-Column PDF Support** — Structural coordinate extraction correctly reconstructs multi-column academic papers and reports.
- 🧪 **Popup Playground** — Open the extension dashboard, drag in any document, and instantly view the structured Markdown preview, copy it to your clipboard, or tweak options.
- 📈 **Savings Dashboard** — Live-track total files processed, original vs. optimized sizes, and estimated cumulative tokens saved.
- ⚙️ **Custom Instructions Template** — Automatically prepend a custom system prompt to every optimized document (e.g., *"Here is the optimized markdown version of my sheet. Tidy up the figures and wait for my instructions…"*).

## 🛠️ Supported Formats

| Format | Library & Strategy | Output | Optimization Pass |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PDF** (`.pdf`) | `PDF.js` with structural coordinate extraction + `Tesseract.js` OCR fallback | Structured `.md` | Column reconstruction, list formatting, sub/superscript mapping, slide-deck deduplication |
| **Word** (`.docx`) | `Mammoth.js` HTML tag compilation | Semantic `.md` | Semantic headers, bold, italics, tables, and list extraction |
| **Excel** (`.xlsx` / `.xls`) | `SheetJS` workbook cell mapper | Table `.md` | Token-efficient clean table rows (blanks and unused cells stripped) |
| **CSV** (`.csv`) | Native text decoder with SheetJS parsing | Table `.md` | Layout-compressed tables |
| **Markdown** (`.md`) | Native text pass-through | Optimized `.md` | Whitespace compaction, multi-newline trimming |

## 🚀 Installation

This extension is installed as an **unpacked developer extension** — it takes less than a minute.

### Step 1 — Fork the Repository

Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

> 💡 Forking first is the recommended workflow — it lets you pull updates cleanly and contribute changes back via pull requests. If you only want to try the extension without a GitHub account, you can use **Code → Download ZIP** instead and skip to Step 3.

### Step 2 — Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Token-Optimizer.git
cd Token-Optimizer
```

### Step 3 — Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle the **"Developer mode"** switch **ON** (top-right corner)
3. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button (top-left corner)
4. Select the cloned `Token-Optimizer` folder
5. Pin **AI Token Optimizer** from your extensions bar for easy access ✅

### Updating

To get the latest version, pull the newest changes and reload:

```bash
git pull
```

Then click the **↻ Reload** button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`.

---

## 📖 Usage

### Automatic Mode (Zero Effort)

1. Visit any supported AI platform (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity).
2. Upload or drag-and-drop a supported document exactly as you normally would.
3. The extension intercepts the upload, converts the file to optimized Markdown locally, and attaches the Markdown version instead — automatically.

### Playground Mode (Manual Preview)

1. Click the **AI Token Optimizer** icon in your extensions bar.
2. Drag any supported document into the popup playground.
3. Instantly preview the structured Markdown output, copy it to your clipboard, or adjust conversion options.
4. Check the **Savings Dashboard** to see your cumulative token savings.

## 🔬 How It Works

### Dual-Layer Event Interception

The extension injects a lightweight, isolated content script (`content.js`) into supported AI domains, plus a MAIN-world script (`inject.js`) for deep page-level hooks. Listeners are registered on the `change` event of `<input type="file">` elements and the `drop` event of drag-and-drop zones during the **capture phase** (`useCapture = true`). This allows the extension to:

1. Halt the platform's own upload handlers (e.g., React file handlers on Claude/ChatGPT) before they fire.
2. Parse and convert the file locally.
3. Programmatically build a new optimized file using the `DataTransfer` API.
4. Re-dispatch the event so the platform uploads the optimized Markdown seamlessly.

### Local Conversion Pipelines

The core engine (`converter.js`) leverages high-performance, sandboxed browser APIs and Web Workers to read file buffers:

1. **PDF Parse** — Reconstructs paragraphs, matches font baselines to capture mathematical sub/superscripts, filters out visual-only components (images, diagram labels), reconstructs multi-column layouts, and falls back to local OCR for scanned pages.
2. **Word Parse** — Compiles Mammoth's HTML output into lightweight semantic Markdown.
3. **Excel/CSV Parse** — Cleans spreadsheet tables, drops completely empty rows/columns, formats dates, and generates standard pipe-separated GFM tables.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

We believe your data is yours alone. **AI Token Optimizer** requires no internet-access permissions (other than matching chat sites for script injection) and contacts **zero external APIs or servers**.

- 🟢 **No telemetry or analytics tracking**
- 🟢 **No remote script loading** — all libraries (including OCR models) are fully bundled locally
- 🟢 **No file logging or third-party cookies**
- 🟢 **Minimal permissions** — only `storage` (for your settings and savings stats) and content-script access to the four supported chat domains

You can verify every claim above yourself — the entire source code is in this repository, unminified where authored by this project, with no build step.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Uploads aren't being intercepted | Refresh the AI platform tab after installing/reloading the extension (content scripts inject at page load). |
| Changes to the code aren't taking effect | Click **↻ Reload** on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`, then refresh the platform tab. |
| A specific document parses incorrectly | Open the popup playground, drag the file in, and inspect the preview. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/vinitgirdhar/Token-Optimizer/issues) with a sanitized sample file. |
| Scanned PDF returns little/no text | OCR runs locally and can take longer on large scans — give it a moment. Very low-resolution scans may extract poorly. |
